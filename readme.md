# Sussy Malware ඞ
A really sus spamware created using the rust programming language for the [hackarmour](https://hackarmour.tech) CTF malware reverse engineering challenge.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

## Notes:
- This malware is only created for the CTF competition and has no harmful effects. But still do not run the malware in a folder containing useful documents
- This malware is only based on linux based machines for now.

## Instructions
- Unzip the release, using `unzip sussy-malware.zip`
- Change the directory using `cd sussy-malware`
- Make the binary executable using `chmod +x ./sussy-malware`
- Open a file explorer to observe the behaviour.
- As visible, there are some dummy documents to show the behaviour the malware, and it will only affect the documents inside that folder to prevent accidental loss of inormation.
- Run the executable using `./sussy-malware` and follow the instructions
- Do not close the terminal window if you fail to give the correct flag, or it will not restore the information. But still if you found the flag it will be valid and you dont have to worry about the documents.
